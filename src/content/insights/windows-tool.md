The construction industry casts a long shadow.  While it provides the essential framework for our lives, its environmental impact is undeniable. From resource depletion and pollution to energy consumption and waste generation, traditional construction practices take a toll on our planet. But a revolution is brewing, and at the forefront is ScrewFast, a company demonstrably changing the game with its commitment to sustainable practices.

## The Scope of the Challenge

Imagine this: the construction industry is responsible for a staggering 36% of global energy use and a whopping 40% of total CO2 emissions [1].  That's not all.  Buildings and construction are major contributors to solid waste generation, accounting for up to 40%, and gobble up 30% of the world's raw materials [1]. These statistics paint a clear picture: business as usual is simply unsustainable.
