title: "Choose a lucky tree! Measure what good thing will happen recently!"
description: "Unfortunate times make things difficult. Everyone hopes that something good will happen in his or her life. It may be that he or she will be promoted to the top of his or her life and make a fortune. We also hope that bad luck will never come. Choose a tree of luck  you like and test what good things will happen to you in the near future. Let's look at the tests."
