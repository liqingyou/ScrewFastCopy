      text: "A new study shows that people with Long COVID had an increased risk of dying and developing serious health problems compared to people who never had COVID-19.\n\nLong COVID means that symptom lasts weeks, months, or longer. Some symptoms\u2014like fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and chronic pain\u2014affect patients\u2019 daily lives, while others\u2014like organ damage\u2014linger beneath the surface, potentially causing serious illness later on. The new study looks at the latter.\n\nIn the year after their COVID-19 diagnoses, people with Long COVID were significantly more likely to seek care for health problems including irregular heartbeats, blood clots, strokes, heart disease, heart failure, and respiratory disease. Irregular heartbeats and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were the most commonly treated conditions among people with Long COVID.\n\nPeople who were hospitalized with COVID-19 when they first got sick were especially likely to later have health problems. More than half got treatment for irregular heartbeats, more than 40% got treatment for COPD, and almost 30% got treatment for heart disease.\n\nAlmost 3% of the people with Long COVID died in the year after their initial COVID-19 cases, compared to just over 1% of the people who hadn\u2019t been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nThere are a few caveats to the research. First, health records aren\u2019t a perfect data source because they only include people who sought medical care, which excludes people who either didn\u2019t have access or were well enough to manage their symptoms at home; health records also may not reflect every symptom someone experiences. Second, the study looked at people who got COVID-19 in 2020, before vaccines were available. While vaccines do not entirely prevent Long COVID, they reduce the risk of developing it. Finally, it\u2019s possible that some people had COVID-19 but didn\u2019t know it.\n\nThe study adds more support to an increasingly solid conclusion: COVID-19 leaves its mark on the body in myriad ways, some of which last far longer\u2014and are more serious\u2014than a few days of flu-like symptoms."
