      text: "I'm Linda, 28 years old. After graduation, I worked in a company, and it took me five years to climb to the top of the company. Now, I am a company boss of a large scale. Although I have been successful in my career at a young age, I have made little progress in my relationship.\n\nAs we grow older, we will be thirty years old. My family is worried about me, and I think it's time to have a good relationship. For so many years, I have been obsessed with my work, neglecting my quality of life, and seeing that everyone around me has married and had children, but I am still a leftover girl.\n\nI don't want to ask for a room and a car when we are dating like other people. I want to find a man who is sincere and not fake. So I want to do this blind date in a special way. The female boss pretends to be poor to go on a blind date. This method is really exciting. In fact, my appearance is quite ordinary. If I don't wear beautiful clothes, I am no different from ordinary women on the street.\n\nOn the date of the blind date, I not only wore plain clothes, but also had a plain face. I didn't carry much cash with me. I carried a cloth bag and went to the blind date place by subway. After arriving at the blind date place, the other party obviously dressed much more ceremoniously than I did. It looked like a very stable young man. Although not so handsome, it was also decent and comfortable, which also met my first level standard.\n\nLater, I learned from my chat with him that he is also an executive of a company, and his monthly salary is more than ten thousand. It seems that the economic conditions are good, but will he dislike my simple appearance now? When ordering, I ordered spicy food in order to show my forthright personality. We had a pleasant conversation afterwards, and he didn't show any dissatisfaction with me.\n\nI feel more and more fond of him. I feel that this man's behavior is very elegant. But when it came to dinner, something unexpected happened to me. How can a man with such elegant manners make the mistake of dropping chopsticks when he sees the man always dropping chopsticks when eating? This made me wonder.\n\nSo I began to find out what kind of medicine he was selling. Unexpectedly, I looked down and decided to marry no other man. The food I ordered was spicy, but the other party was not used to it, so in order not to embarrass me, he had to pretend to drop his chopsticks and spit the rice in his mouth into the garbage can.\n\nI was so touched by such a thoughtful manner that I finally showcased with him to explain my identity. Unexpectedly, he was not only not angry, but also appreciated my practice. Now that we are in love, I wish we can reach the end and hope that he and I can have a complete marriage!"
