      text: "His son Ken is very filial and sensible. He knows what his mother Elaine wants most. Before Elaine spoke, his son took the initiative to bring his girlfriend home to Elaine. Elaine was very satisfied with her son's girlfriend, who was dignified and generous, gentle and virtuous. Although the financial conditions of the girl's family are general, the parents of the girl do not dislike that her son is a single-parent family. In this way, both parties agreed to get married.\n\nAfter marriage, the couple lived happily although they were not rich. Although Elaine lives with her son and daughter-in-law, in order not to cause trouble to her son, she usually takes odd jobs to supplement her family. Within a year, the daughter-in-law became pregnant and gave birth to a fat boy. Elaine was happy and took care of her daughter-in-law and grandson at home every day. But the problem is that the daughter-in-law has not gone to work since she was pregnant and weak. Elaine takes care of her grandchildren and sons at home, and does not go out to work part-time. The family has lost two jobs at once, because raising children is more expensive. Before the daughter-in-law had a baby, his son accepted the job of traveling to other places because of the high subsidies.\n\nWhen his son is away on business, Elaine and his daughter-in-law and grandchildren are left at home. After her son left, Elaine found something wrong with her daughter-in-law. The daughter-in-law has become fond of bathing, which is not a big deal at all, but she often bathes eight times a day, and each time is very long.\n\nElaine felt something was wrong, so she asked her daughter-in-law, who only said that it was hot and she took a shower. Finally, one time, her daughter-in-law was taking a bath again, but she didn't lock the door. Elaine quietly opened the door and found that \nher daughter-in-law didn't take a bath at all, but was using the computer and didn't know what she was doing.\n\nElaine came up to her daughter-in-law and asked her that her daughter-in-law was distressed that her husband was working too hard on business trips, but Elaine did not agree with her to go back to work, so her daughter-in-law found a part-time job online to subsidize her family. The daughter-in-law lied that she was \"taking a bath\" every day. In fact, she was working secretly during this time, trying to relieve some pressure at home.\n\nElaine choked and hugged her daughter-in-law. Elaine said that her son was lucky to have such a wife.\n\nElaine's family loved each other and worked hand in hand to tide over the difficulties. Their life will surely be better!"
