      text: "Rosen is 60 years old and lives with his only daughter Vivian on weekdays. Speaking of it, Rosen had a hard life. After two years of marriage, his wife had just given birth to a daughter and ran away with other men, leaving him and his daughter alone.\n\nFor her daughter, she has experienced all kinds of hardships and difficulties. Rosen finally raised her daughter. In recent decades, all his efforts have been put on his daughter.\n\nMy daughter is very obedient. She studies hard, goes to college, graduates and works, and has a smooth journey. In the eyes of others, she is envious. However, in his father's heart, there was one thing that kept him awake at night: his daughter was 40 years old, but she never married.\n\nYou know, girls in their 20s should get married locally. But at the beginning, my daughter was busy with her study and work, and all kinds of excuses were not getting married.\n\nAsk the matchmaker to introduce the blind date, and the result is always the same. Within two or three days, they broke up with each other. Many times, people are not willing to introduce their daughter.\n\nThe father was very angry. He quarreled with his daughter many times and asked what was the matter? The daughter hesitated and never said anything. In fact, my daughter looks pretty. Why not get married? Father was puzzled.\n\nUntil one day, when my father cleaned the room, he accidentally smelled that the bed was very smelly. He opened the bed and looked at it. He was stunned! The bottom of the bed is filled with all kinds of men's clothes, such as pants, sweatshirts, etc.\n\nWhen her daughter came home, she saw that her father had found her, so she had to bow down and tell the truth.\n\nIt turned out that when I was a child, my father always complained about the failed marriage. Gradually, the daughter became afraid that men were not good things. When I grew up, I didn't have any interest in love and marriage. Instead, I wanted to be a man. So I bought a lot of male clothes and hid in my room secretly.\n\nAfter hearing this, the father regretted his death and couldn't help crying. Because for more than ten years, he always complained about his divorced wife with his daughter every day when eating. Today's result is all caused by him!"
