      text: "There were many sisters in my family when I was young. Life is not very good. My parents are superstitious. A few months after I was born, my mother went to divination. The old man said that I would marry a rich man in the future. My parents were very happy to hear the news. They raised me. So I am happier than other children. Give me the good things first. I read more books than they do. I can see that they hate me very much. After graduating from high school, I failed. I worked in a factory in the town. When I was 20 years old, I met my husband under the introduction of a matchmaker. After marriage, we live with our mother-in-law. She is a very strong woman. Her husband is very restrained in her presence. She refused to keep close relationship with me in her own home.\n\nAlthough I am very interested in this mother-child relationship, I also feel very strange, because after marriage, my husband has been sleeping on the sofa. My husband's mother doesn't care about our sex life. Others said that \"it is better not to take care of grandchildren\". Because of this, I am very disappointed with my family life, but my parents refused to divorce me. It is not easy to get married and go to the big city. The good days have not passed yet. I was asked to endure. I think what my parents said is also reasonable, so I will try my best to manage the housework and serve my husband's mother. But my efforts did not change my husband's enthusiasm. A few years later, my husband refused to even share a room with me. I'm too lazy to argue with my husband. Five years later, her husband's mother died. Because she is old and seriously ill.\n\nAs soon as she went out, I filed for divorce with my husband, who gave me the house. As soon as he went out, he wanted to clean up and rent the house. On the day I moved, I wanted to move the sofa down and throw it away. When I lifted the sofa cushion, I was covered. There was a premarital examination report under the sofa mat that said that I was infertile, which surprised me. When I remembered, I called my husband. After listening, he said, \"My mother said that you care very much about whether you can have children or not, because she was afraid of hurting your self-esteem, so she hid it. I can't give you a better life. I can't afford IVF, so I have to find a way.\"\n\nAfter listening, my tears came out. I decided to remarry. We will have a good life in the future. Although not living a rich and noble life, it is my greatest happiness to meet such a wonderful husband and mother-in-law."
