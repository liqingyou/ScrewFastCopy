Zhang Hao was angry and ran away from home, Lao Zhang looked for a long time but didn't find his son, the police did not find, slowly Lao Zhang did not find, but he still missed his son very much, so that he couldn't sleep every night, and soon Lao Zhang's body couldn't stay up, Lao Zhang was sick, so he went into the city alone trembling to see a doctor, Lao Zhang wrapped himself tightly, for fear of suffering the wind and cold again, just at the door of the hospital, a young man bumped him, and ran away without even saying a word of apology, Lao Zhang also nagged two sentences: \"The young people are really unqualified now\", and then casually touched his pocket, the wallet was gone, Lao Zhang panicked, and quickly found the police station to report the case, but Lao Zhang is not familiar with here, Lao Zhang can't find a place, in fact, it doesn't matter if money is not money, The important thing was what was inside, Lao Zhang couldn't help it, so he had to sit stupidly in front of the hospital, he hoped that the young man would return the wallet to him, so Lao Zhang sat there and waited.\n\nAfter the thief stole the wallet, he found a place to open the wallet to see how much money there was, when he opened it, he cried for what he saw inside, and then strode to the hospital to find Lao Zhang, and after finding Lao Zhang, he knelt down and shouted: \"Dad, I was wrong.\" This sound woke up the sleeping Lao Zhang, it turned out that Zhang Hao did not recognize Lao Zhang at first, Lao Zhang wrapped himself too tightly, but when he opened his wallet and saw the family portrait, Zhang Hao couldn't bear it anymore, he felt that he was so bad, Lao Zhang patted his son and said: \"Knowing and correcting mistakes means that you are still a good child, that's because I spoil you too much that you make so many mistakes, Dad is also wrong, Zhang Hao followed his father home, and then found a job with peace of mind to accompany his father well and never fool around anymore."
