      text: "Though \u201CWarning\u201D, written in 1961, was voted Britain\u2019s most popular postwar poem in one poll, it didn\u2019t drive a surge in merrily misbehaving old matrons \u2014 at least not in the style she envisaged. Instead, at least judging by the press, older women get more invisible by the day. The lack of substantial acting roles for older women is so marked that a campaign to change it received Equity backing last year. And many women over 50 complain about feeling pushed aside and pushed out of the workplace.\n\nA widely-trailed movie, out this week, seeks to challenge this narrative. Good Luck To You, Leo Grande is a two-hander in which Emma Thompson plays Nancy, a widowed schoolteacher in her early sixties, who hires handsome young rentboy Leo Grande (Daryl McCormack). The film documents their interactions over a number of meetings, as Nancy sets out to tick off a list of sexual experiences she never enjoyed with her late husband.\n\nIn this, it takes aim at a common experience described by older women: that as far as wider social perception is concerned, as women age we\u2019re no longer seen as valuable. There\u2019s some truth in this, at least at the superficial level of who gets ogled on the beach. According to the founder of dating website OKCupid, men of every age tend to rate women in their early twenties as looking the best.\n\n\nExceptionally beautiful women must feel this keenly. Paulina Porizkova, once the world\u2019s most highly-paid model, clearly does: she told The Times earlier this year how she just doesn\u2019t seem able to pull any more. \u201CI am now completely invisible,\u201D she says. \u201CI walk into a party, I try to flirt with guys and they will just walk away from me mid-sentence to pursue someone 20 years younger. I\u2019m very single, I\u2019m dressed up, I\u2019ve made an effort \u2014 nothing.\u201D\n\nThere is, in other words, something robustly consistent about what induces men to stop what they\u2019re doing and stare at a woman. The fact that the age of maximum perceived female hotness coincides with the age of peak fertility strongly implies that it has a material basis, something recognised by writer Ayelet Waldman: \u201CI remember reading some study that men can sense a woman who\u2019s fertile, and they focus their laser beam eyes on a fertile woman,\u201D she said. \u201CWell, as soon as you\u2019re not fertile anymore, it\u2019s like they just skip over you.\u201D\n\nThe fact that it isn\u2019t tells us something about how uncomfortable we\u2019ve become at the idea that our bodies impose any constraints at all. And it\u2019s often self-styled feminist women who push hardest against the constraints of sex, challenging the idea that women should be seen as fertile first and people second. Meanwhile, academics and activists alike call for us to envision brave new worlds of sex wholly disconnected from reproduction.\n\nIn this context, Leo Grande has been widely celebrated as empowering. Stuff the idea that our bodies constrain us, and that we stop being sexual later in life, it declares \u2014 we\u2019ve moved past imagining that sex and fertility are connected at all. Older women can also want, need and enjoy pleasure!\n\n\nBut in reality, older women are, in this sense, far from invisible. A recent poll announced that the age at which women feel hottest is in fact 53; campaigns such as Rock My Menopause and GenM encourage positive representation of menopausal women, and articles celebrate the joys of dating older women.\n\nThe same desire to resist the constraints of biology lurks behind another common theme: the celebration of older people engaging in activities stereotypically associated with youth \u2014 especially the \u201Csexy\u201D ones. Last week, for example, the Guardian published an enthusiastic profile of the Sun City Poms, a troop of retiree cheerleaders in Arizona. Last year, a retirement-home pole-dancing class made the news.\n\nDesire, we gather, doesn\u2019t have a sell-by date, and older people still get horny; the French are here as ever, with advice on shagging, the NYT is here as ever to take photos of you doing it. And if you end up catching an STI in the process, there are papers on the need to \u201Ceducate\u201D healthcare professionals to stop assuming sexual health for retirees is just about Viagra.\n\nBut while it\u2019s of course true that older people get horny, in truth the premise of Leo Grande doesn\u2019t challenge what\u2019s behind female invisibility at all. Rather, it entrenches it. For it has very little to offer all those women for whom not having to be sexy any more is not a bug, but a feature. If, unlike the Paulina Porizkovas of this world, you\u2019re among the far larger body of women who\u2019ve made something other than looks the focus of your life, you may well find it a blessed relief when the gaze of male strangers begins to skip you in favour of younger, perkier women. In that context there are many upsides to ageing, including dressing for comfort, men talking to your face rather than your boobs, and (joy!) having lunch solo without being buttonholed by horny weirdos."
