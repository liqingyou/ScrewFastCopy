      text: "Alethea is a poor woman. In her early years, she went out with her husband in an accident, and her husband died in the accident. Although Alethea saved her life, she has some disability in one leg, which makes Alethea's life very inconvenient. At that time, Deb, Alethea's son, was only five years old. Although Alethea could not do heavy work, he had to pick up waste to support his son.\n\nLater, Deb grew up. Although he reached the age of marriage, no girl wanted to marry him. The reason is that Deb's family is too poor, and the house is still the old adobe house. Alethea was worried when she saw her son getting older. Later, she simply collected money to demolish the old house and rebuild it. With a new house, Deb married his wife Anne into the house within a year.\n\nAfter his son married, Alethea lived with his son's daughter-in-law. At the beginning, the family's life was also very harmonious, because Alethea's body was relatively strong at that time. She not only contracted all the household chores, but also sometimes went to collect garbage to earn money. The money she earned was basically paid for her son.\n\nOver the past years, Alethea is also old, and her body is different from the past. She can't work and often gets sick. When Alethea saw this, his son and daughter-in-law not only did not take her to the hospital for treatment, but also often scolded her for eating leftovers for her. Alethea was very sad every day.\n\nLater, the bad things that Deb and his wife did to Alethea were known by the village people, and many people in the village pointed out to them. Deb's daughter-in-law was not happy. In order to avoid gossip from the villagers, she simply drove her mother-in-law out of the house. Alethea is old and homeless, and can only live by begging in the street. It's windy and rainy outside. Alethea often sleeps in the street, and almost froze to death several times. Fortunately, Alethea survived, but the life is very hard.\n\nTwo years passed after Alethea's life. One day, Alethea saw a luxury car parked in the street while begging on the roadside. He thought that the man must have money and wanted to beg. So Alethea limped past and came down to a young woman. Alethea quickly put out a broken bowl and whispered, \"Girl, please give me some money to live for my old woman!\" Unexpectedly, the girl saw Alethea so, suddenly holding Alethea's hand and said excitedly, \"Grandma, are you grandma, I am Xiaomei!\" Alethea was dazed with old eyes, and only remembered that Xiaomei was her granddaughter's name, However, she had been sold by her son more than 20 years ago, but she was very strange to me. Then the girl gave Alethea her own ID card, and Alethea recognized that the girl was his granddaughter Eva.\n\nIt turned out that 25 years ago, Alethea's son Deb sold his five-year-old daughter to others in order to save his two-year-old son. As for Alethea's granddaughter, she didn't live well in the family she bought. She dropped out of school and went to work outside before finishing junior high school. Maybe it was more sensible than ordinary people. Later Eva started the company with her own efforts, and her income this year was more than ten million. Eva was very impressed with her grandmother. What she missed most for so many years was her grandmother. So she went back to her hometown to look for her grandmother. Unexpectedly, she met her begging grandmother in the street on the first day of her visit. This may really be fate.\n\nEva heard that her grandmother was driven out by her parents, and her resentment towards her parents deepened. On that day, she specially arranged 20 luxury cars to return to her hometown, all of which stopped in front of her parents' house. When Deb learned that it was his daughter's car, he was shocked. He thought that his daughter was coming to pick him up and enjoy his happiness. Unexpectedly, his daughter took his mother out of the car, Then he said to him bitterly, \"Dad, I appreciate you selling me, otherwise I would not be today. I wanted to give you some pension, but you even drove your own mother out of the house. You are so heartless. From today on, my grandmother and I have nothing to do with you!\"\n\nWith that, Eva pulled Grandma into the car and drove away. Looking at the cars going away, Deb was full of thoughts. He began to regret what he had done, but there was no regret medicine in the world after all. Wrong is wrong, and there is no way to turn back!"
